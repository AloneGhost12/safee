# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for tridex.app/safee/

## Why .htaccess Doesn't Work for GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages uses a different server configuration than Apache. The `Server: GitHub.com` header confirms this is GitHub Pages hosting, not Apache.

**Apache vs GitHub Pages:**
- ❌ Apache: Uses .htaccess for URL rewriting 
- ✅ GitHub Pages: Uses 404.html for SPA routing

## Correct Deployment Process

### 1. Build for GitHub Pages
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
npm run build:github-pages

# OR manually:
cd client
./build-for-github-pages.ps1
```

```bash
# Linux/Mac
npm run build:github-pages:bash

# OR manually:
cd client
bash build-for-github-pages.sh
```

### 2. Deploy to Repository

**Option A: Direct Repository Access (Recommended)**
If you have access to the tridex.app repository:

1. Clone or access the tridex.app repository
2. Create/navigate to the `/safee/` directory in the repository
3. Copy ALL contents from `dist/` folder to `/safee/` directory
4. Commit and push to the main branch

```bash
# Example commands if you have repo access:
git clone https://github.com/username/tridex.app.git
cd tridex.app
mkdir -p safee
cp -r /path/to/your/project/client/dist/* safee/
git add safee/
git commit -m "Deploy Personal Vault to /safee/ subdirectory"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Contact Repository Owner**
If you don't have direct access:

1. Build the project using the scripts above
2. Zip the entire `dist/` folder contents
3. Contact the tridex.app repository owner
4. Request them to:
   - Create a `/safee/` directory in the repository
   - Upload all files from your `dist/` folder to `/safee/`
   - Commit to the main branch

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:
- ✅ `https://tridex.app/safee/` - Should load the app
- ✅ `https://tridex.app/safee/vault` - Should route correctly
- ✅ Refresh on any route should work without 404

## File Structure in Repository

After deployment, the repository should have:

```
tridex.app/
├── safee/
│   ├── index.html          # Main app entry point
│   ├── 404.html           # SPA routing handler (critical!)
│   ├── favicon.ico        # App icon
│   ├── assets/            # CSS, JS, and other assets
│   │   ├── index-[hash].css
│   │   ├── index-[hash].js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── [other built files]
└── [other repository files]
```

## Key Files Explained

### 404.html (Critical for SPA Routing)
- Handles all route redirects for React Router
- Prevents refresh loops
- Must be in the `/safee/` directory
- GitHub Pages automatically serves this for missing routes

### index.html
- Main application entry point
- Contains base path configuration: `/safee/`
- Links to assets with correct paths

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 404 errors:
1. ✅ Verify files are in the correct `/safee/` directory
2. ✅ Check that 404.html exists in `/safee/404.html`
3. ✅ Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for the repository
4. ✅ Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

### If refresh loops continue:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies for tridex.app
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check browser console for errors

## Environment Configuration

The build is configured for:
- **Base Path**: `/safee/`
- **API URL**: `https://safee-y8iw.onrender.com`
- **App Name**: `Personal Vault`

## Next Steps

1. **Run the build script**: Use `npm run build:github-pages`
2. **Deploy to repository**: Upload dist/ contents to `/safee/` directory
3. **Test the deployment**: Visit https://tridex.app/safee/
4. **Clean up old files**: Remove unnecessary Apache-related files

---

**Important**: This is a GitHub Pages deployment, not Apache hosting. The 404.html file handles all SPA routing automatically.
