# File Preview Enhancement - Complete Implementation

## Problem Solved
You were encountering "Preview not supported" messages for files that should be previewable. I've significantly expanded the file type detection and preview capabilities.

## What Was Improved

### 1. **Expanded File Type Support**
- **Before**: Only `text/`, `image/`, and `pdf` MIME types
- **After**: Support for 40+ file types across 7 categories

### 2. **Enhanced Detection Logic**
- **MIME Type + File Extension**: Now checks both MIME type and file extension for better accuracy
- **Fallback Detection**: If MIME type is incorrect, file extension provides backup detection
- **Common Extensions**: Added support for common extensions that might have generic MIME types

### 3. **New Preview Categories**

#### Text Files (Enhanced)
- Plain text, logs, config files, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, Markdown
- **Preview**: Up to 100KB of content displayed

#### Code Files (New)
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Go, Rust, SQL, Shell scripts, CSS, HTML
- **Preview**: Syntax-aware display with monospace font

#### Media Files (New)
- **Videos**: MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV, WMV, MKV - HTML5 video player with controls
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, FLAC, AAC - HTML5 audio player with controls

#### Documents (Enhanced)
- **PDFs**: Full embedded preview
- **Office Docs**: Word, RTF, ODT - Download prompt with preview info

#### Images (Enhanced)
- All image formats with zoom (25%-400%) and rotation controls

### 4. **Improved User Experience**

#### Better File Icons
- More specific icons based on file type
- Better visual identification in file list

#### Enhanced Preview Modal
- Video player with controls
- Audio player with visual feedback
- Document preview with download prompts
- Improved error handling

#### Better Error Messages
- More informative messages for unsupported files
- Clear guidance on what to do next

## Supported File Extensions

```
Text: .txt, .log, .ini, .conf, .cfg, .env, .gitignore, .dockerfile, .readme, .md, .csv, .json, .xml, .yaml, .yml

Code: .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx, .py, .java, .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .php, .rb, .go, .rs, .sql, .sh, .bash, .ps1, .bat, .css, .scss, .less, .html, .htm, .vue, .svelte

```

## How It Works Now

1. **Smart Detection**: System checks both MIME type and file extension
2. **Fallback Logic**: If MIME type is generic, extension-based detection kicks in
3. **Appropriate Preview**: Each file type gets the most suitable preview method
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Unsupported files show clear "download to view" message

## Security Maintained
- All previews still require password authentication
- Rate limiting (10 preview attempts per 5 minutes)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Virus scan validation

## Result
Most common file types now preview correctly instead of showing "Preview not supported". The system is much more user-friendly while maintaining the same security standards.

## Testing Recommendations
Try previewing these file types to see the improvements:
- Upload a `.js` or `.py` file → Should show code preview
- Upload a `.mp4` video → Should show video player
- Upload a `.mp3` audio → Should show audio player  
- Upload a `.txt` or `.log` file → Should show text content
- Upload a `.json` or `.xml` file → Should show formatted content
