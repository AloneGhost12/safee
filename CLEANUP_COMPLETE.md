# Project Cleanup - Removed Tridex.app References

## What Was Causing the Problem

The `/safee/` subdirectory configuration was set up for deploying to `https://tridex.app/safee/` but was causing routing issues and confusion.

## Files Cleaned Up

### ✅ Configuration Files Updated:
- `client/.env.production` - Changed `VITE_BASE_PATH` from `/safee/` to `/`
- `client/package.json` - Updated build scripts to use root path
- `client/build-for-*.ps1` and `.sh` - Updated all build scripts

### ✅ Documentation Files Removed:
- `TRIDEX_URL_ROUTING_FIX.md`
- `TRIDEX_404_FIX.md`
- `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `GITHUB_RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`

### ✅ Debug Files Removed:
- `debug-online-reload-issue.js`
- `debug-production-issues.js`
- `test-reload-fix.js`

## Current Configuration

Your app is now configured for **root deployment**:

- **Base Path**: `/` (root of domain)
- **API URL**: `https://safee-y8iw.onrender.com`
- **Build Output**: Clean, without subdirectory references

## How to Deploy Now

### For Regular Hosting:
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ contents to root of your domain
```

### For GitHub Pages (if needed):
```bash
npm run build:github-pages
# Upload dist/ contents to repository root
```

## No More Issues

- ❌ No more `/safee/` references
- ❌ No more tridex.app confusion
- ✅ Clean, simple configuration
- ✅ Works with any hosting provider at root domain

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the built files to your actual domain root
2. Test the app without subdirectory complications
3. Everything should work normally now!
