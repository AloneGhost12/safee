# File Preview and Enhanced Security Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds secure file preview functionality and enhanced password protection for file operations in the vault application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Preview System
- **Preview Modal**: New modal component that displays file content without requiring full download
- **Supported File Types**:
  - Text files (with content display up to 50KB)
  - Images (with zoom, rotation controls)
  - PDFs (embedded viewer)
  - Unsupported files (graceful fallback)

### 2. Enhanced Security
- **Password Protection**: All file operations (download/preview) now require password verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all file access attempts
- **Session Validation**: Enhanced token validation for secure operations

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Password Prompt Modal**: Secure password input with show/hide toggle
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading states for all operations
- **Keyboard Support**: ESC key support for closing modals
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Components

#### 1. PasswordPrompt Component (`/client/src/components/PasswordPrompt.tsx`)
- Secure password input with visibility toggle
- Loading states and error handling
- Keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close)
- Auto-focus for better UX

#### 2. FilePreviewModal Component (`/client/src/components/FilePreviewModal.tsx`)
- Multi-format file preview support
- Image controls (zoom, rotate)
- Responsive design
- Keyboard navigation

#### 3. Enhanced FileManager Component
- Added preview button to file cards
- Password protection for all file operations
- Integrated preview and download workflows
- Enhanced error handling

### Server-Side Enhancements

#### 1. File Access Middleware (`/server/src/middleware/fileAccess.ts`)
- Rate limiting for file operations
- Password validation
- Audit logging system
- Session validation

#### 2. Enhanced File Routes (`/server/src/routes/files.ts`)
- New preview endpoint with password protection
- Enhanced download endpoint with security
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit trail integration

#### 3. Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 download attempts, 10 preview attempts per 5 minutes
- **Password Verification**: Required for all sensitive operations
- **Virus Scan Checks**: Prevents access to infected files
- **Session Validation**: Enhanced token verification

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/files/:fileId/preview` - Get file preview with password
- `POST /api/files/:fileId/download-url` - Get download URL with password

### Security Headers
- Rate limiting headers with retry information
- Comprehensive error responses
- Audit trail integration

## Usage

### Preview a File
1. Click "Preview" button on any file
2. Enter password in the security prompt
3. View file content in the preview modal
4. Option to download from preview modal

### Download a File
1. Click "Download" button on any file
2. Enter password in the security prompt
3. File downloads with progress indication

## Security Considerations

### Password Protection
- All file operations require password verification
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Failed attempts are logged and monitored

### Data Protection
- File content is only loaded after authentication
- Preview content is limited (50KB for text files)
- All operations are audited

### Session Security
- Enhanced JWT validation
- Session timeout protection
- Secure header validation

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Downloads: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
fileAccessRateLimit(5, 300000)

// Previews: 10 attempts per 5 minutes  
fileAccessRateLimit(10, 300000)
```

### Preview Limits
- Text files: Maximum 50KB preview
- Images: Full resolution with controls
- PDFs: Embedded viewer
- Other files: "Unsupported" message

## Error Handling

### Client-Side
- Network error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported files

### Server-Side
- Comprehensive error logging
- Rate limit exceeded responses
- Virus scan status validation

## Audit and Monitoring

### Logged Events
- File preview attempts
- File download attempts
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit violations

### Log Format
```typescript
{
  userId: string
  fileId: string
  action: 'preview' | 'download'
  timestamp: Date
  ipAddress: string
  userAgent: string
  success: boolean
  errorMessage?: string
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Preview**: Support for more file types (Word, Excel, etc.)
2. **Preview Caching**: Cache preview content for better performance
3. **Advanced Security**: CAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts
4. **Collaborative Features**: Share preview links with expiration
5. **Analytics**: File access analytics and reporting

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load preview content on demand
2. **Compression**: Compress preview data transmission
3. **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for faster preview delivery
4. **Background Processing**: Generate previews asynchronously

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Preview different file types
2. Password protection validation
3. Rate limiting behavior
4. Error handling and recovery
5. Keyboard navigation
6. Mobile responsiveness

### Security Testing
1. Brute force protection
2. Session validation
3. File access authorization
4. Audit trail accuracy

This implementation provides a comprehensive file preview system with robust security measures, ensuring users can safely preview their encrypted files while maintaining the highest security standards.
